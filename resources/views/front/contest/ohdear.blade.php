            <a href="https://ohdear.app">Oh Dear</a> monitors uptime, checks your SSL certificates, crawls for broken
            links and sends out notifications when something's wrong. It checks your entire website, not just the
            homepage.

            In times of crisis, a public status page allows you to communicate to your clients. We'll host your status
            page so it's always available. You can focus on providing updates to your users. Here are the Oh Dear
            powered status pages for <a href="https://status.laravel.com">Laravel</a> and <a
                href="https://status.flareapp.io">Flare</a>.
        <p>
            When something is wrong, Oh Dear can notify you via Slack, SMS, Pushover, ... we can notify you wherever
            your
            team is active. It has a developer friendly API and <a href="https://ohdear.app/docs">kick-ass docs</a>.

            We've partnered with <a href="https://contestkit.com">ContestKit</a> to give away a coupon that allows you
